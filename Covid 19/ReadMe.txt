We completed problem statements 1 and 3 successfully. However, even with the sites you provided, we were unable to progress with problem 2 as the data available online has age groups like 10-19, 20-29 etc, and the age group you asked for is 15-25. We didn't approximate data for the loss of genuity of data. We have to go through a valid data set with the age group 15-25. We are still trying to find the ideal data set for that problem and develop the code.
